KITHUB

KitHub is a multi-page web app built with React, Firebase, and the Makeup API. Users can search for cosmetics products, then sign in via Google authentication to save coveted cosmetics to a wishlist or their own personal kit of already-owned products.

KitHub was built by Laura-Louise Tobin, Jackie Lealess, and Orry Mevorach as part of Hacker You's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp in June, 2018.
